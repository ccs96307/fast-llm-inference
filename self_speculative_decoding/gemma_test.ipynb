       "  'content': 'Tony Robbins describes six core human needs that drive our behaviors and motivations. These six needs are:\\n\\n1. Certainty: The need for safety, stability, and predictability. This includes the need for comfort, security, and control over our environment.\\n2. Variety: The need for novelty, excitement, and change. This includes the need for adventure, stimulation, and new experiences.\\n3. Significance: The need to feel important, special, and unique. This includes the need for recognition, achievement, and respect.\\n4. Connection: The need for social connection and love. This includes the need for intimacy, belonging, and friendship.\\n5. Growth: The need for personal growth and development. This includes the need for learning, self-improvement, and progress.\\n6. Contribution: The need to make a positive impact in the world. This includes the need to give back, help others, and make a difference.\\n\\nAccording to Tony Robbins, these six needs are universal and apply to all individuals. Each person may prioritize these needs differently, and may fulfill them in different ways, but they are fundamental drivers of human behavior. By understanding these needs, individuals can gain insight into their own motivations and behaviors, and can use this knowledge to create a more fulfilling and meaningful life.'}]"
